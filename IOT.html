        <h2>What is Internet of Things?</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          Internet of Things is a network of physical objects or "things" that
          are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect
          and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
          These devices can range from simple sensors and actuators to more
          complex machines and appliances, such as smartphones, cars, home
          automation systems, industrial machinery, and wearable devices.
        </p>
        <h2>Brief History of IOT</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          The concept of IoT dates back to the early 1980s when computer
          scientist John Romkey developed the first internet-connected device, a
          toaster that could be turned on and off over the internet. However, it
          wasn't until the 1990s that the term "Internet of Things" was first
          coined by Kevin Ashton, a British technology pioneer, who envisioned a
          world where everyday objects were connected to the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          In the years that followed, advancements in miniaturization, wireless
          networking, and cloud computing technology paved the way for the
          growth of IoT. In 1999, the Auto-ID Center was founded at MIT with the
          goal of developing a global standard for RFID (radio frequency
          identification) technology, which is used to track and identify
          objects in IoT
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          By the early 2000s, IoT was becoming more mainstream, and companies
          were starting to develop IoT applications for various industries. In
          2008, the first IoT conference was held, and by 2010, the number of
          internet-connected devices surpassed the number of people on the
          planet.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Today, IoT continues to evolve and expand, with more and more devices
          being connected to the internet every day. The rise of 5G networks,
          edge computing, and artificial intelligence is expected to further
          fuel the growth of IoT and usher in a new era of innovation and
          connectivity.
        </p>
        <h2>How IOT Works?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sensors and devices: These are physical objects that are embedded
            with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to
            collect data and interact with the environment. Examples include
            temperature sensors, motion detectors, and smart appliances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connectivity: IoT devices connect to the internet through a variety
            of wireless and wired networks, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and
            cellular networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data processing: Once the data is collected, it is processed and
            analyzed using cloud-based or edge computing technologies to extract
            insights and actionable information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applications: The insights gained from the data analysis can be used
            to inform decision-making and automate processes in various
            applications, such as smart homes, industrial automation, and
            healthcare.
          </li>
        </ul>
