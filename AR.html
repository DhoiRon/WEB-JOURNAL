      <section>
        <h2>What is Augmented Reality?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Technology that combines virtual
                information with the real world.
            </li>
            <li>It uses Multimedia, 3d Modeling,
                real-time tracking and registration,
                Intelligent interaction, sensing and
                more.
            </li>
            <li>Applies computer-generated
                virtual information such as text,
                image, video, etc. to the real
                world after simulation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Digital Reality</h2>
        <p class="inline">Digital reality refers to the wide
            spectrum of technologies and
            affordances that include Augmented
            Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality
            that simulate reality in various ways.</p>
        <p class="inline">Emerging immersive technologies that
            are able to create a totally artificial
            virtual environment through computer
            generated contents.</p>
        <h2>Digital Reality - Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p class="inline">A combination of real scene viewed by a user
          and virtual scene generated by a computer that
          augments the scene with an additional
          information.</p>
        <p class="inline">An enhanced version of the real physical world
          that is achieved through the use of digital visual
          elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli and
          delivered via technology.</p>
        <h2>Types of Virtual Reality:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Immersive</b> – a perception of being physically
            present in a non- physical world</li>
          <li><b>Non immersive</b>- large display but doesn’t
            surround the user</li>
          <li><b>Windows</b>- desktop-based VR involves
            displaying a 3d virtual on regular desktop
            display without use of any specialized
            movement tracking environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mixed Reality</h2>
        <p class="inline">Mixed reality (MR) is an emergent technology that blends virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

          These days, mixed reality describes environments in which real and virtual subjects and objects interact in real
          time — and in which you can interact with both real and virtual components. This requires a headset that has
          either a transparent lens or a camera, so that you can still see the real world. Note that the Windows Mixed
          Reality headset is a VR headset with a camera.</p>
        <h2>Applications of Augmented Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gaming:</b> Augmented reality can be used to create immersive gaming experiences, where virtual objects and characters are overlaid onto the real world.</li>
          <li><b>Education and training:</b> AR can be used to create interactive educational materials, such as textbooks or museum exhibits, that provide additional information or context to real-world objects.</li>
          <li><b>Advertising and marketing:</b> AR can be used to create engaging and interactive advertisements that allow customers to see and interact with products in a new way.</li>
          <li><b>Architecture and design:</b> AR can be used to create 3D models of buildings and structures, allowing architects and designers to visualize and modify designs in real-time.</li>
          <li><b>Healthcare:</b> AR can be used to assist medical professionals during surgeries or other procedures, providing them with real-time information and guidance.</li>
          <li><b>Healthcare:</b> AR can be used to assist medical professionals during surgeries or other procedures, providing them with real-time information and guidance.</li>
          <li><b>Tourism:</b> AR can be used to provide visitors with interactive guides and information about landmarks and attractions.</li>
